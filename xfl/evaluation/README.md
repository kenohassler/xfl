# Pretrained DEXTER embeddings

Our experiment data is too large to host on Github. Therefore, we make pre-trained DEXTER embeddings for our dataset available from the following [link](http://ec2-34-254-193-199.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/dexter_embeddings.csv.xz).

Secondly, a pandas dataframe from our experiments with raw feature values is available from the following [link](http://ec2-34-254-193-199.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/dexter_exp_data.pickle.xz).
